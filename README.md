# Machine Learning Sentiments on Urdu Text

## üìå About the Project
This project focuses on sentiment analysis for Urdu text using machine learning and deep learning models. With over 300 million Urdu speakers worldwide, sentiment analysis for Urdu has been underexplored due to a lack of resources and datasets. This research aims to bridge this gap by implementing various NLP techniques and classification models to analyze sentiments in Urdu movie reviews.

## üîç Problem Statement
Traditional sentiment analysis models primarily focus on English and other Western languages. Due to the complexity of the Urdu language, existing NLP methods fail to deliver optimal results. The key challenges include:
- Right-to-left script processing
- Lack of annotated datasets
- Complex grammar and morphological structure
- Tokenization and word segmentation issues

## üéØ Approach - Project Planning & Aims Grid
1. **Dataset Preparation:** Used a dataset of 50,000 Urdu movie reviews with positive and negative labels.
2. **Preprocessing:** Implemented stop-word removal, lemmatization, and tokenization.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Applied TF-IDF, Bag of Words (BoW), and Word2Vec.
4. **Classification Models:** Used Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
6. **Optimization:** Fine-tuned hyperparameters and performed cross-validation to improve accuracy.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - TensorFlow & Keras (Deep Learning)
  - Scikit-learn (ML Models)
  - NLTK & UrduHack (NLP Processing)
  - Gensim (Word2Vec)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- **Dataset Source:** GitHub, Kaggle
